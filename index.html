        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Jialin Luo. I  was born and raised in Guangdong, Zhongshan, China. I  moved to the states when I  was 10 years old and since then I grew a significant amount of interest in the states' economy. When I was a freshmen in high school, I  worked at sunshine kids after school care where I  tutored younger students from k-12 and assisted them on their daily class activities. Not long after, I  started working at kumon which is another tutoring center for younger students. I  have many years of experience in working with kids, I'm very patient and kind which I  think are traits you should and must have in order to work with younger kids. 
<br><br>

        After years of being a tutor, I  wanted to try something different. I  decided to work at Meet fresh which is a Taiwanese dessert place in Fremont, California. I  started off as a barista making drinks and desserts for customers and later I  was promoted to become a shift leader. Being a shift lead wasn't hard but it wasn't necessarily easy either. Being the shift lead meant that I  had to work extra hours especially when the managers aren't there. My role as a shift leader was to open and close cash registers, making sure things run smoothly while the managers aren't there, collecting and creating employee shift schedules using excel, replying to customer complaints on yelp, and training new employees. Throughout my years at Meet fresh, I  was able to gain a deeper meaningful understanding behind business management and how important it is. It takes more than one employee to get the store running and team work is super important when working at any places. 
<br><br>

        On top of my job experience from meet fresh, I  was also delighted to work for several months at a Chinese restaurant in Pleasanton, California. There I  was able to gain an understanding of how restaurants run and what it takes to keep the store running. My job at King Wah Seafood Restaurant was to take phone orders, and running the check for customers when they arrive at the store to pick up their food. Throughout my experience at this restaurant, I  have once again realized how important collaborative teamwork is. It's also important to not panic and stress out when customers are angry because it will just slow down the store even more. Lastly, I was so glad I  was able to intern at a startup called Bookmarq. Bookmarq is an app that was created to link book readers all across the globe together. With this app, users can suggests books to other users or ask for suggestions and recommendations from other users. Throughout my internship at Bookmarq, I mainly tested the functionality of the app and analyzed customer retentions on a day to day basis. Additionally, I  was able to shadow the interworking of the startup by attending their staff meetings. Through my experience at Bookmarq, I  was able experience the life of starting a startup and what it takes to keep it running.
